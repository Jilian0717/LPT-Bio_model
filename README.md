# LPT-Bio_model
Lagrangian particle tracking and biological (LPT-Bio) model based on SCHISM (https://github.com/schism-dev/schism)

• plot_Chla.m: main matlab code to plot Chl-a from particle tracking results and compare it with satellite-derived chl-a

#### Other plot-related files:
• Other color.m; colorData.mat: Colormap files downloaded from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30564-othercolor

• hgrid.gr3: horizontal grid for schism input

• bnd_node.txt: node ID for model boundary

• bayall*: Chesapeake Bay shoreline file

• /sentinel/: satellite images covering the tracking period from 07/28/2020-08/06/2020; downloaded from NOAA Algal Bloom Beta/Experimental Products (https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw_html/NCCOS.html)
