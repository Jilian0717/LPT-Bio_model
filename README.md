# LPT-Bio_model
Lagrangian particle tracking and biological (LPT-Bio) model developed based on SCHISM (https://github.com/schism-dev/schism)

• plot_Chla.m: main matlab code to plot Chl-a from particle tracking results and compare it with satellite-derived Chl-a

• exmaple .mat file: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6499558

#### Other plot-related files:
• othercolor.m, colorData.mat: colormap files downloaded from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30564-othercolor

• hgrid.gr3: horizontal grid 

• bnd_node.txt: node ID of model boundary

• bayall*: Chesapeake Bay shoreline file

• /sentinel/: qualified satellite images covering the tracking period from 07/28/2020-08/06/2020; downloaded from NOAA Algal Bloom Beta/Experimental Products (https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw_html/NCCOS.html)
