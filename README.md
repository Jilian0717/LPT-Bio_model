# LPT-Bio_model
Lagrangian particle tracking and biological model based on SCHISM

• plot_Chla.m: plot Chl-a from particle tracking results and compare it with satellite-derived chl-a

• Other color.m; colorData.mat: Colormap files downloaded from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30564-othercolor

• sentinel*.tif: satellite images covering the tracking period from 07/28/2020-08/06/2020; downloaded from NOAA Algal Bloom Beta/Experimental Products (https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw_html/NCCOS.html)

• hgrid.gr3: horizontal grid for schism input
• bnd_node.txt: node ID for model boundary
• bayall*: Chesapeake Bay shoreline file
