source code for the harmful algal bloom model developed in [Xiong et al (2023)](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10308). The general idea for this particle-tracking model is to treat a numerical particle as a virtual sensor to record the water temperature, salinity, nutrient concentration (mainly DIN here), turbidity, and light intensity (or other factors) that were experienced by each particle during its transport. The particle will also record a concentration to represent the changing algal biomass, which can grow or die based on the surrounding environments of each particle. Giving an initial concentration, the changing algal biomass can be soved by dC/dt = gC, where g is the net growth rate. A more complete description about the governing equations
